//8.	Write a program that displays a menu of five items in a chip shop as follows:
//Cheeseburger	£4.99
//Pepsi		£2.00
//Chips		£2.50
//Mexican Beef	£5.00
//Pizza		£6.50
//Prompt the user to choose an item using the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) that corresponds 
//to an item.  After the user makes the selection, display the total owed and ask the user 
//to input the amount of cash tendered to pay for the item.  This will be in note format 
//and can be either £5, £10 or £20.  Display the change payable to the user.
