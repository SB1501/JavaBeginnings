//	A lawn-mowing service needs a program to work out their pricing strategy. 
//The lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks. The weekly fee mowing a lot under 400 m2 
//is £25. The fee for a lot that is 400 m2 or more but under 600 m2 is £35 per week. 
//The fee for a lot that is over 600 m2 is £50 per week. Prompt the user for the length 
//and width of a lawn and then print the weekly mowing fee, as well as the 20-week seasonal fee.
//Update the program to prompt the user on how the customer wants to pay (1) once, (2) twice, 
//or (3) 20 times per year. If the user enters 1 for once, the fee for the season is simply the 
//seasonal total. If the customer request two payments, each payment is half the seasonal total 
//plus a £5 service charge. If the user requests 20 separate payments add a £3 service charge per 
//week. Display the number of payments the customer must make, each payment amount and the total 
//for the season.
