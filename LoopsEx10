//UNCONDITIONAL LOOPS Ex10
//Q. Write a program that displays a menu of five items in a chip shop (same as If Exercise). Prompt the user to choose 
//an item using the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) that corresponds to an item or to enter 0 to quit the application. After 
//the user makes the first selection, if the choice is 0, display a bill of £0. Otherwise display the menu again. The user 
//should respond to this prompt with another item number to order or 0 to quit. If the user types 0, display the cost of the single requested item. If the user types 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, add the cost of the second to the first and then display the menu a third time. If the user types 0 to quit, display the total cost of the first two items; otherwise, display the total for all three selections.
