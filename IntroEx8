//A car with a purchase price of Â£15000 is bought on hire purchase at an interest rate of 
//5% over 5 years.  Assuming the yearly interest is calculated at the beginning of each 
//year on the amount owed at that point, calculate and output both the total interest and 
//the total amount repaid by the customer.
