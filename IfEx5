//5.	Write a program that prompts an employee for hourly rate of pay and hours worked. 
//Compute the gross pay (hours times rate), tax and net pay (gross minus tax). Tax is computed 
//as a percentage of gross pay based on the following:
//Gross Pay		Tax %
//Up to and including £300	 	 10
//£300.01 and up		 12
//Modify the above using the following tax percentage ranges:
// Gross Pay			Tax %
// £0 to £300		 	10
//£300.01 to £400.00	 12
//£400.01 to £500.00	 15
//£500.01 and over		 20
