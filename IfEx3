//Write a program for a college's admission office. Prompt the user for a student's 
//numeric high school grade point average (eg 3.2) and an admission test score from 0 
//to 100. Print the message "Accept" if the student has any of the following:
//•	A grade point average of 3.0 or above and an admission test score of at least 60
//•	A grade point average below 3.0 and an admission test score of at least 80
//If the student does not meet either of the qualification criteria, print "Reject".
//Modify the program above so that if a student enters a grade point average under 0 or
//over 4.0 or a test score under 0 or over 100, an error message appears instead of the 
//"Accept" or "Reject" message.
